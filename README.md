# why does it work
potassium's auth really only checks if ur credentials are good when they first setup, then if ur user.bin looks legit *enough* they'll just let it slide, so this keygen takes advantage of that

# and now the how
potassium uses a user.bin file for their authentication, but it's just a json file, with a JWT and expiry<br>
if we set this jwt to our own arbatrary value, we get our own 'free' liscense!

# disclaimer
i will not be providing a download to the Potassium files, if you want them, you should buy a key or smth.<br>
this was just some testing i did, i recommend you go buy the cheat, as this will likely be fixed very soon
